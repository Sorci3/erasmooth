													<h3>The lights of the night</h3>
													<p>Author : Herbreteau Mathis <br> Date : 20/01/2025</p>
													A cool thing to compare with your home country when you go to Finland, and you plan to live there 
													is the duration of the day. For example, in France, in January the average day duration is around 
													8 or 9 hours with a sunrise at around 8am and a sunset at around 5pm. These numbers change 
													throughout the year and are very different in each country. Here in Finland, in early January the 
													average day duration is 5 hours with a sunrise at around 10am and a sunset at around 3pm. It can 
													be very disturbing at first to go out at 3pm to visit the city and unfortunately its already the 
													night and you need to navigate in the city with lampposts light.
													<br>
													<br>
													When we talk about lamppost in Finland, it is not the most ecological invention they made, because 
													they just stay lighten up all the night. The main point to this is to protect the citizens, because 
													at night, the risks for drivers and pedestrians are much higher. With all the ice and the snow, people 
													need to see where they are walking or driving because the ground is very slippery, and it is verry easy 
													to fall. And as French people, we have already almost fallen multiple times in broad daylight, so we 
													don’t dislike having a little light at night. 
													<br>
													<img src="images/uniquethings/Lampadaires.jpg" alt=""/>
													<h4>1. Here is an exemple of the city at night.</h4>
													<br>
													The real problem with this is the light pollution. As you may know, Finland is known for its northern lights,
													 and unfortunately, if there is too much light, it is very hard if not impossible to see them. It also ruins 
													 the beauty of the night sky and can disrupt animals, insect and humans at night. Because yes, the use of 
													 artificial lights at night, can have an impact on the human circadian cycle. If you are exposed to too much 
													 light during the evening it can interfere with the body’s natural production of melatonin, the hormone that 
													 regulates sleep. This can make it harder to fall asleep, reduce sleep quality, and lead to fatigue during the 
													 day. Our first nights there were quite short, and it was really hard to sleep since thy don’t have blinds in 
													 Finland, they only have curtains. But we got used to it and everything is fine now !

												<h3>Clue me in 1st edition</h3>
												<p>Author: Bonneau Axel <br> Date: 21/01/2025</p>
												<p>
													Welcome to the first edition of “Clue Me In.”
												    Your objective: Find the word or theme I’ll be talking about today in the shortest time possible. 
												    Let’s get 
													started!
												</p>
												<p>
													I’m describing a medium-sized, brown animal measuring around 65 to 85 centimeters.
													It is an omnivore that feeds on worms, seeds, and insects. This animal is a bird with a long,
													tapering tail and lives quite close to human civilization. It is typically found near rural areas and villages.
												</p>
												<p>
													Here’s your final hint: during mating season, 
													this bird gathers a group of females (a “harem”) and performs elaborate rituals to seduce them. 
													These rituals involve loud crowing and dramatic wing-flapping displays.
												</p>
												<p>
													The pheasant is primarily an Eurasian bird but originates from China. It was introduced to Central Europe and Finland on a massive scale (more on that later).
													The pheasant holds different meanings in various cultures. In China, this bird symbolizes good fortune and beauty. In European mythology, it is often associated with fertility. For Native Americans, the pheasant is an honored creature, representing harmony with nature.
													Today, pheasants are primarily bred for hunting. In the United Kingdom alone, around 47 million pheasants are released from captivity each year for this purpose. Finland follows a similar practice.
												</p>
												<p>
													Hunting pheasants in Finland is relatively easy, as only three conditions must be met:
												</p>
												<ul>
													<li>You need a Finnish hunting card, which can be obtained by passing a €20 hunting test.</li>
													<li>You must have the landowner’s permission to hunt on their property.</li>
													<li>You need the proper license to possess a firearm.</li>
												</ul>
												<p>
													Once these requirements are fulfilled, you can legally hunt!
													As I mentioned earlier, pheasants are not native to Finland. They were introduced at the beginning of the 20th century, and their current population density is approximately 0.1 pairs per square kilometer. Interestingly, pheasants need to be fed by humans during Finland’s cold winters.
													Today, pheasants are among the most popular game birds in Finland, alongside other birds.
