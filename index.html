													<h3>The lights of the night</h3>
													<p>Author : Herbreteau Mathis <br> Date : 20/01/2025</p>
													A cool thing to compare with your home country when you go to Finland, and you plan to live there 
													is the duration of the day. For example, in France, in January the average day duration is around 
													8 or 9 hours with a sunrise at around 8am and a sunset at around 5pm. These numbers change 
													throughout the year and are very different in each country. Here in Finland, in early January the 
													average day duration is 5 hours with a sunrise at around 10am and a sunset at around 3pm. It can 
													be very disturbing at first to go out at 3pm to visit the city and unfortunately its already the 
													night and you need to navigate in the city with lampposts light.
													<br>
													<br>
													When we talk about lamppost in Finland, it is not the most ecological invention they made, because 
													they just stay lighten up all the night. The main point to this is to protect the citizens, because 
													at night, the risks for drivers and pedestrians are much higher. With all the ice and the snow, people 
													need to see where they are walking or driving because the ground is very slippery, and it is verry easy 
													to fall. And as French people, we have already almost fallen multiple times in broad daylight, so we 
													don’t dislike having a little light at night. 
													<br>

													<h4>1. Here is an exemple of the city at night.</h4>
													<br>
													The real problem with this is the light pollution. As you may know, Finland is known for its northern lights,
													 and unfortunately, if there is too much light, it is very hard if not impossible to see them. It also ruins 
													 the beauty of the night sky and can disrupt animals, insect and humans at night. Because yes, the use of 
													 artificial lights at night, can have an impact on the human circadian cycle. If you are exposed to too much 
													 light during the evening it can interfere with the body’s natural production of melatonin, the hormone that 
													 regulates sleep. This can make it harder to fall asleep, reduce sleep quality, and lead to fatigue during the 
													 day. Our first nights there were quite short, and it was really hard to sleep since thy don’t have blinds in 
													 Finland, they only have curtains. But we got used to it and everything is fine now !

													<h3>Snow in Finland</h3>
													<p>Author : Le Pottier Mathias <br> Date : 19/01/2025</p>
													Before we start, a bit of background :<br>
													Finland is nordic country wich is famous for its winter landscapes and the snow play a crucial role in many of them. Due to the climate, snow cover Finland for a long period (it can be from november to april) and so much snow influence the culture, life style and activities of Finnish. <br>
													During the same period the daylight isn’t long (10am to 3pm) and even if the combination of the snow, the darkness and potential aurora borealis create a magical ambiance, the lack of sunlight affect the moral of everyone in a bad way.
													During winter, the average temperature is -15°C (even if, for the moment it’s warmer for us, more between -5°C and 4°C) so there is ice everywhere and it’s very slippy. The most of us are well equipped for the winter climate with technical footwear and thermal clothing but when there is wind you get cold very quickly.
													<br><img src="images/article/IMG20250108151845 - .jpg" alt="" /><br>
													Now, our main subject :<br>
													When we first arrive, we tried throwing snowballs at each other as any normal human would have done, the problem was that the snow was a little bit different than in France (when there is snow of course…), the snow was as hard as ice. It was so cold when we arrive that the snow was just pieces of ice… Our plan for a snowball fight has been compromised.
													Later, some of us managed to make a snowman (so you can made snowman even with icy snow, good to know I guess…), but this isn’t all, in Finland, snow means lots of activities like skiing, snowboarding or even snowmobile safaris. Of course there is also the famous activity where you go to the sauna and there you plunge into the water of a frozen lake.
													However, recent climate change is having an impact on snowfall in Finland. Winters are becoming milder, especially in the south, which is a major concern for the whole country.
