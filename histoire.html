									<h3 class="major">History</h3>
									<p>Inhabited since prehistoric times, the earliest populations in Finland were organised around hunting, fishing and agriculture. For several centuries, Finland was a battleground between its powerful neighbours, Sweden and Russia. Annexed by Sweden in the 12th century, it remained under Swedish rule until 1809, when it was ceded to Russia and became an autonomous Grand Duchy. Despite Russian rule, the Finns retained their unique language and culture. In 1917, taking advantage of the Russian Revolution, Finland proclaimed its independence. However, its recent history has been marked by hardship, notably the Winter War against the Soviet Union in 1939-1940. Today, Finland is known for its high-performing education system, its commitment to social rights and its cultural identity deeply linked to nature and the sauna.</p>

									<h3 class="major">How to get there</h3>
									<p>The first step to our travel was to book our train tickets for Charles de Gaule Airport because we booked a flight between Paris and Helsinki. We left Angers on the 3 of january at 16pm to arrive at the airport at 18:30pm. We then slept at the airport and took our flight to Helsinki at 6:50am. The flight duration was about three hours but Helsinki have a time difference with Paris of one hour so we arrived at Helsinki Airport at 10:50am. And then, after eating inside the airport we began the last part of our travel, we took a train between Helsinki and Seinajoki and our travel took an end. We of course collected the keys of our appartments and our Erasmus began. <p>

									<h3 class="major">Student life</h3>
									<p>On our first day in Seinäjoki we visited the campus with all the exchange students. We discovered the different buildings, study spaces, and the cafeteria. Our courses are mainly technical english classes and intercultural communication, which really immerge us in the English language. Later, in March, technical courses will start, offering us more specialized training. Living in Seinäjoki also requires good preparation to face the Finnish cold. Wearing clothes such as thick coats, gloves and boots for exemple is essential to go out in the cold.<p>
